<div class="test1">
  <button (click)="buttonClicked()">Increase valueX and person's age</button>
  <p>This is child, valueX: {{ valueX }}, person age: {{ person.age }}</p>

  <i>
    Note: <br>
    The input <strong>valueX</strong>  does not change in parent when changed in child - it's a primitive input value <br>
    However, the value in the person-object changes, because it's a reference to the same object (same
    space in memory).
